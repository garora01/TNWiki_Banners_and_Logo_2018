## Guidelines (Create a banner)

1. Avoid copyright infringement! 
You must avoid using images that are not yours when you create a Facebook banner.

2. The banner should fit Facebook groups
    1. Facebook banner size: make sure you create a banner with the right size. Facebook banners are 851 x 315 pixels.
    2. Facebook add buttons above the image on the right bottom corner. Make sure that the buttons fit the image. Make sure the buttons do not cover something in the image like the name “TechNet, Wiki, Microsoft, and so on)
    3. It is recommended to test your banner! You can create a temporary group and test your banner. When we choose the best banner we do the same. We will test it on Facebook in order to confirm that it fits well

3. Be creative, Keep it fresh

4. You are welcome to get help from friends who are photographers or illustrators. Don’t forget to add their name and their Facebook page.

P.S. the banner should fit Facebook.
